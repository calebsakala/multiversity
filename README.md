Multiversity is an online community where prospective students can find universities that meet their criteria. [Visit Multiversity](https://www.multiversity.wiki) to try it out!

## About

Multiversity is a social platform that takes a different approach to university finding. Prospective students can search for universities (and scholarships) via filters that exclude search results that do not meet their constraints - and at the same time, users who have opportunities to share can make posts about opportunities that can appear in the search results of others! Users can follow other users, report other users, like posts, flag posts, and so much more! 

## Usage

Using Multiversity is simple:

1. [Visit Multiversity](https://www.multiversity.wiki) in your web browser.
2. Click on the search bar in the middle of the screen.
3. Specify your constraints (i.e. what course you want to study or what scholarship percentage you prefer).
4. Press "Search!" (it will always be at the bottom of the screen).
5. If you see any interesting search result, click on the search result to see more information (which will include who posted it, what language you must speak, eligibility criteria, scholarship benefits/possibility information etc.)

Please note that Multiversity is not an official or all-authoritative source of information about universities and scholarships. While I endeavor to keep the information on Multiversity correct and up to date, all the content about universities on Multiversity is provided by users - who may be misinformed or have nefarious motives.

## Technologies Used

Multiversity is built using the following technologies:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL, MySQL, AWS (does AWS belong in the 'backend' category?)
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API

Happy university-finding!
